#VirtualPlantsProject

##What is it?

Mini school project about 3D plants generation algorithms. Thanks to the INRIA team [Virtual Plants](https://team.inria.fr/virtualplants/).

##How do I run it?

###UNIX users

First, install OpenAlea. Just Google it, I'm too lazy to write a tutorial at the moment.

Install `ipython` if you do not already have it. Go into the src/ folder :

```
cd src/
```

Then launch `ipython` by simply running the following command :

```
ipython
```

Then, when you are in the `ipython` environment, run the following commands :

```
%gui qt4
%run test_plants
```

###Windows users

Please install a UNIX distribution. No, really, it's for your own good.
